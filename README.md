# RL-Agents

Various of Reinforcement Learning agents. Tested on OpenAI Gym environments.
Repository was made because without implementing RL agents by myself, it is hard to grasp how the algorithms really work.

Current agents that are available:
  - **REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient)** [*done, cart-pole*] using Tensorflow
  - **A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)** [*done, mountain car continuous*] using Tensorflow
  - **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** [*done, bipedal walker*] using PyTorch
 
Experiments using Tensorflow and Pytorch framework to test RL-agents and to see if Tensorflow or Pytorch is easier for me to use.
Current state (opinion) : Pytorch is easier for complex model, Tensorflow is easier for simple model
